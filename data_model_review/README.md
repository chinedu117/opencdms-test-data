# Climate Data Management Systems - Data Model Review

## Data model types

The WMO Guidelines on climate data management ([WMO 2007](#wmo_2007)) establish three data model types that can be used to classify the approach taken in CDMS implementations.

| Model name                 | Description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| **Element Model (EM)**     | An Element Model represents data in tables, having, in each row, *different values* of *one element* observed at one station *at different times*. |
| **Observation Model (OM)** | An Observation Model represents data in tables having, in each row, the values of *different elements* observed at one station *at a given time*. |
| **Value Model (VM)**       | A Value Model will represent the data values in tables having, in each row, *only one value* of *one element* observed at one station *at a specific time*. |

The following summaries are taken from ([WMO 2007](#wmo_2007)).

### Element Model

| Stationâ€™s ID | Month/Year | Element | Value day 1 | Value day 2 | Value day 3 | Value day 4 | Value day 5 | â€¦ | â€¦ | Value day 31 |
|--------------|------------|---------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|---|---|--------------|
| 95123        | 01/2002    | Tmin    | 23.4        | 25.2        | 28.3        | 26.5        | 27.8        | â€¦ | â€¦ | 24.9         |
| 66202        | 01/2003    | Tmax    |             |             |             |             |             | â€¦ | â€¦ |              |
|              |            |         |             |             |             |             |             | â€¦ | â€¦ |              |

**Advantages:** It is easy to add new elements; the data model remains the same even if a new element is added.\
**Disadvantages:** Performance for real-time applications may be poor; many operations on the database can be more complex than would otherwise be the case.
