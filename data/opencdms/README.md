This directory contains the initial shared test database for prototyping and testing with supported systems including Climsoft, MCH and CliDE. 

The dataset is currently based on a dataset with complete metadata provided by the Met Office and modified for use in the PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB database system.

The dataset is initially being used with the OpenCDMS Python Data Management API ([pyopencdms](https://github.com/opencdms/pyopencdms)) and supported Web APIs ([opencdms-api](https://github.com/opencdms/opencdms-api)).
