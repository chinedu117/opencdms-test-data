ASSEMBLY SUBROUTINE:  RDCHAR.ASM

The NEW subroutine Assembly RDCHAR.ASM reads the characters and its attribute
at the current cursor position.  This subroutine will replace the subroutine
QRTEXT that was used in FORTRAN programs DEFFROM.FOR and DEFSCRN.FOR in CLICOM 
version 2.5 and 3.0.   The subroutine QRTEXT was original from the GRAFMATIC
Library (Scientific/Engineering) Graphics.
