Loading data from key-entry files into DataEase (choice 3, Climate data
entry and quality control) is performed by the programs LDDATA, NODUPMRG,
and WTBTMRG2 and the batch files MERGE and MERGE2.  In most cases the
system will detect a sharing violation error and the user can choose to
either abort, or retry and wait until the files are available.  The most
serious errors are the ones that occur when the DataEase files are
accessed.  If the user aborted, the key entry files can be checked using 
menu choice 3.1.  If the data remains in the key entry file, the user can
restart the loading process from the beginning.  If the data is no longer
accessible and a new backup index file (xxxxxx.BDX) has been created, the 
data can be recovered by copying the file xxxxxx.BDX to
xxxxxx.IDX.  This procedure can be performed as long as the key entry file
has not been modified.  If the user aborted during the creation of the
DataEase index files, re-indexing can be performed manually using the 
procedures listed in Appendix F - Troubleshooting of the Reference Manual.
