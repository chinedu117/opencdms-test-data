Problems with incompatible graphics devices and saved displays.

In various parts of CLICOM graphic images are saved and redisplayed.  This
procedure requires that the saved image be redisplayed on the same type of
graphics device and at the same resolution as it was when it was saved.  
Problems may be encountered when running CLICOM on a network if the server
and readers have different types of graphics display devices.  In AREA-QC
this problem will usually result in a display showing the station locations
without a map background.  This problem can be resolved by defining a
separate map for each different graphics device using menu choice 5.4.1.
Before initiating AREA-QC, the user must link the appropriate map file
to the dataset he will be using by choosing menu choice 5.4.2.  A similar
problem will occur when a predefined graphics screen is displayed on an
incompatible graphics device.  In this case the only solution is to remember
that if the user wishes to display a graphics image on a specific device, it
must be saved on a compatible device.
