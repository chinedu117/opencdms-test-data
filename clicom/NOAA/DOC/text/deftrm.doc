                     DEFINITION OF DATA TERMS
                     
                     
   1. GRAPHICS.API
      This is the graphics data file.  It is a temporary file that contains 
      all the data that will be used in the currently defined series of 
      plots.  The data is logically arranged in rows and columns.  Usually 
      the rows represent time and the columns represent elements.
      
   2. FRAME
      This is a logical group of rows in the GRAPHICS.API file that extends 
      across all columns.  The grouping depends only on the data type and 
      plot type.  Once these are chosen, it cannot be changed.  For example, 
      a timeseries plot using daily data would have frames that were equal 
      to one month (rows) of data for all the selected elements (columns).
      
   3. BAND
      This is a group of all the rows in the GRAPHICS.API file that will
      appear on a single graph and extends across all the columns.  The
      number of rows in a band may be less than, equal to, or greater than
      the number of rows in a frame.  The boundaries of a band do not have
      to align with the boundaries of a frame.  No two bands of data within 
      the same file may overlap.  If, for example, a timeseries plot of
      daily data displayed two months of data at a time, then the band 
      would be equal to two months (rows) of data for all the selected
      elements (columns).
      
   4. PLOT
      This is a group of all the columns in the GRAPHICS.API file that will
      be displayed together and extends across all the rows in the band.
      If, for example, a timeseries plot of daily data displayed two months
      of data for two elements, then the plot would be equal to two
      elements (columns) of data for all the rows in the band.
      
   5. BAND LOCATION BY POSITION
      The band starts and stops at a set position (row) in a frame.  For
      example, if two months of daily data are displayed on a graph, the 
      band is defined by the following positions:
         Start = Row 1 of first frame (month) 
         Stop  = End row of last frame (month)
         Span  = 2 frames (months)
      Note that the length of the bands are not constant because the 
      number of days in a month vary.   
         
   6. BAND LOCATION BY INTERVAL
      The band is defined by a set number of rows.  For example, if 14
      days of daily data are displayed on a graph, each band would have
      a length of 14 rows (days).
