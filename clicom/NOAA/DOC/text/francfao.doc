Denis Stuber:

Replace your current versions of GRAFINIT.EXE and MESSAGES.FTN with the files
on this diskette.  DFSTNLST.HLP is a new file that should be copied to the
directory \CLICOM\HELP.

The three files on this diskette were modified/created in order to display a 
maximum of 32000 stations when a user defined station selection list is 
created.  In addition, several errors in the station selection list procedure 
were corrected.  This procedure was tested using about 800 stations.  Please 
let us know if you have any problems using this procedure with large numbers 
of stations.  

We added a new feature to the station selection list procedure.  We hope this 
will make it easier to work with large numbers of stations.  We added another 
function key, F3, which allows you to move to a specified page in your list of
stations.  After F3 is entered, the user is prompted to enter a page number.  
You can page either forward or backward.  If you enter a page that is greater 
than the maximum number of pages, you will be positioned at the last station
available.

The message file contains the following changes:
a) modified messages -- 583, 593
b) new messages      -- 612, 613, 614

I hope these modifications help solve your problems with station selection.
Please let us know how everything works out and if you need any additional
help.
