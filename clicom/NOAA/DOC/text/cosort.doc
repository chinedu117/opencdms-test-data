               UPGRADE COSORT FROM PREVIOUS VERSION TO VERSION 4.4


     IF YOU HAVE UPGRADED TO COSORT VERSION 4.4 ON YOUR CLICOM SYSTEM, YOU MUST
MODIFY THE COSORT.COR FILE TO CORRECT A CONFLICT BETWEEN COSORT'S MERGING
PROCESS AND CLICOM REQUIREMENTS.  THE COSORT VERSION 4.4 MERGES ONLY UP TO 3
FILES WHILE CLICOM SYSTEM EXPECTS TO MERGE UP TO 6 FILES WHEN YOU RETRIEVE THE
CLIMATE DATA FROM OFF-LINE ARCHIVE INTO DATAEASE.  IN ORDER TO MEET CLICOM'S 
REQUIREMENTS THE COSORT.COR FILE OF VERSION 4.4 MUST BE MODIFIED BY RUNNING THE
BATCH FILE UPGCSORT.BAT FROM CLICOM INSTALLATION DISK 1.  

        BEFORE YOU BEGIN THE UPGRADE PROCEDURE, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE COSORT 
VERSION 4.4.  OTHERWISE, THERE IS NO NEED TO MODIFY THE COSORT.COR FILE.  TO
RUN THE UPGRADE PROCEDURE YOU MUST FOLLOW THE STEPS LISTED BELOW:


STEP 1.  PLACE A CLICOM INSTALLATION DISK NUMBER 1 INTO DRIVE A.

STEP 2.  CHANGE TO THE DRIVE WHERE THE COSORT FILES ARE LOCATED.

STEP 3.  AT THE DOS PROMPT TYPE  "A:UPGCSORT"  AND PRESS THE RETURN KEY.

STEP 4.  DURING THE UPGRADE PROCEDURE, YOU WILL BE ASKED TO ANSWER THE 
         FOLLOWING QUESTIONS BY ENTERING "YES" OR "NO":  
              a. IS YOUR COSORT VERSION 4.4 ?  (Y/N)
              b. ARE YOU IN THE DRIVE WHERE "COSORT" FILES ARE LOCATED ?  (Y/N)
