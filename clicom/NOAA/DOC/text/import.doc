The skeleton programs for IMPORT1 and IMPORT2 assume that the data in the
digital input file is recorded by observation.  This means that each record
contains multiple elements recorded at a single time.  Although multiple
stations may be included in the file, the data format is converted for one
station at a time.  The program assumes that the file is sorted by station
and date.  If your file does not meet these specifications, the import
programs will require major revisions.

Before you can run the import programs, you must create a control file.  The
programs need to know which elements are in the input record and in what order
they appear.  They also need to know what representation indicates missing 
data for each element.  Use your text editor to create a file 'IMPCTRL.DLY'
in your CLICOM/DATA directory.  This file must contain 2 records:
Record 1 contains a comma delimited list of the CLICOM element codes in order
of their appearance in the input record.
Record 2 contains a comma delimited list of the values in the input record
that denote missing for each element.


IMPORT1  Importing custom digital data directly into the DataEase files.

1.  Modify the IMPORT1 program to read your data format.  The following 
    sections of the code usually require revision.  The actual code in the
    program is prefaced with detailed comments.
    a. Add the file name to the statement opening the input data file.
    b. Revise the statement opening the output file so that it conforms to
       the syntax of your FORTRAN version by choosing 'NEW' or 'UNKNOWN'
       for the status of the file.
    c. Revise the READ statement for the input file to match your variable
       type and format.
    d. Add necessary code to convert input data to a form compatible with
       the output format.      
    Note that the DataEase file structure in CLICOM is fixed and NO 
    modifications should be made to the WRITE statements in IMPORT1.   

2.  Compile and test the modified program.

3.  Run IMPORT1 from within CLICOM by choosing choice #7 (Perform a single
    DOS command) from the CLICOM Introductory menu.

4.  Import the file created by IMPORT1 (Q:IMPORT.DAT) into the appropriate
    DataEase form by selecting the 'Import ASCII file into DataEase' choice
    from the 'Export/import climate data' menu (2.2).  The file Q:IMPORT.DAT
    is a VARIABLE LENGTH ASCII file which uses a comma as a FIELD SEPARATOR
    and a carriage return as a RECORD SEPARATOR.  The decimal points are
    already inserted into the fields so DataEase does NOT have to insert any
    decimal points.  The file is organized by FIELD ORDER.  If you are 
    importing into an empty DataEase file, then you should use the choice
    'Do not Match' to process matching records.  If the DataEase file already
    contains data, then you should use the choice 'Add or Update' to process
    matching records.  This choice will allow all new records to be added and
    will prevent duplicate records by overwriting all matching old records.
    
5.  To sort the new DataEase file, exit DataEase and choose choice #7 from the
    CLICOM Introductory menu (Perform a single DOS command).  Type DSORT xxx
    where 'xxx' is the 3 letter abbreviation for the data type loaded (MLY,
    10D, DLY, SYN, HLY, or U-A).  The DSORT.bat file will automatically
    un-index and re-index each of the indexed fields in the appropriate form.
    
6.  Copy the data to off-line storage with the 'Transfer climate data' menu(8).

7.  The data is now on-line in the DataEase file and ready for use.



IMPORT2  Importing custom digital data into DataEase via the key 
         entry/validation file.

1.  Define a Key-entry/Validation form to receive the imported data.  Use
    choice #1 from the ADMIN menu(5).
    
2.  Modify the IMPORT2 program to read your data format.  The following 
    sections of the code usually require revision.  The actual code in the
    program is prefaced with detailed comments.
    a. Add the file name to the statement opening the input data file.
    b. Revise the READ statement for the input file to match your variable
       type and format.
    c. Add necessary code to convert input data to a form compatible with
       the output format.      
    Note that, for output, the program will determine the order of the elements
    in the user's previously defined key entry form and rearrange the input
    elements appropriately.  The data will be written to the key entry form.
    NO modifications should be made to the output code in IMPORT2.   

2.  Compile and test the modified program.

3.  Run IMPORT2 by selecting choice #3 from the 'Climate data key-entry and
    quality control' menu (3).
    
4.  Quality control is performed automatically when you choose to Validate the
    data and call up each of the data entry records.  Validate all of the 'red'
    errors.

5.  Load the validated data by following the steps normally used to load
    validated data into DataEase.  
    
6.  Copy the data to off-line storage with the 'Transfer climate data' menu(8).

7.  The data is now on-line in the DataEase file and ready for use.
