This routine allows the user to specify the level of
detail that is defined by the replacement map.

Each of the detail categories allowed is shown in the menu. 
The user specifies the level of detail by selecting the
appropriate menu choice (coastlines, rivers, borders,
lakes/islands, and states).

NOTE:  State borders are only available for areas in the
       Western hemisphere.


This is help file DTLREPMP.HLP, and is called from the
