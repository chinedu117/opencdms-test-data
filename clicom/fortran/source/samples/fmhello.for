CC  The FMHELLO program illustrates how to use multiple threads.
CC
CC  Use this command line to compile:
CC
CC      FL -MT fmhello.for
CC
CC  Or build the FORTRAN run-time DLL (using the FDLLOBJS batch file)
CC  and compile with this command:
CC
CC      FL -MD fmhello.for frtexe.obj frtlib.lib
CC
CC  To run, specify the number of times you want each thread to say
CC  hello. For example, to start three threads speaking 5, 7, and 9
CC  times, respectively, use this command:
CC
CC      FMHELLO 5 7 9

      INTERFACE TO INTEGER*2 FUNCTION BEGINTHREAD(rtn, stk, size, arg)
      INTEGER*4 rtn [value]

      END

      INTERFACE TO INTEGER*2 FUNCTION DosSleep( time )
      INTEGER*4 time [value]

C
C     Allocate a 2K stack for each thread specified on the command line.
C
      IF( i .GT. 0) ALLOCATE( stack(2048, i) )
C
C     Bring up one thread for each argument.

      DO next = 1, i
         CALL GETARG( next, argbuf, rc )

C
C        Bring up the new thread and pass the corresponding argument.
C

C        Keep track of how many threads were brought up.

C
C     Tell the user how many threads were brought up.
C

C     Let the threads begin execution and wait for them to complete.
C

C
C        Check until a thread signals completion.  Clear flag and
C        start over, until all threads have finished.
C
